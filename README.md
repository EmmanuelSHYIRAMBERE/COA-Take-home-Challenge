<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

This project includes an interactive photo gallery and solutions to two coding challenges. It demonstrates my ability to build a web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and my JavaScript problem-solving skills.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have a modern web browser installed (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/EmmanuelSHYIRAMBERE/COA-Take-home-Challenge.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory
   ```sh
   cd COA-Take-home-Challenge
   ```
3. Open `gallery.html` in your web browser to view the interactive photo gallery project.

4. Test the two challenges i.e., array manipulation and string transformation, with the following options:

- Browser Console

  1. Open your web browser.
  2. Press `F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I` on Windows/Linux OS or `Cmd+Opt+I` on Mac OS
  3. Go to the `Console` tab.
  4. Type or paste your JavaScript code found in `Challenges` folder in the cloned repo and press `Enter`.

- Online JavaScript Editors

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Implementation

- [x] Interactive Photo Gallery

The interactive photo gallery was implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I followed the provided Figma designs to create a responsive gallery that works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices. The gallery includes features such as image thumbnail navigation, full-size image viewing, and any interactions specified in the designs.

- [x] Array Manipulation

The array manipulation challenge involved implementing a function in JavaScript that determines if there exists a contiguous subarray within a given array of integers that sums up to a target sum. The function returns true if such a subarray exists and false otherwise. I ensured that the implementation met the expected time and space complexities and handled all possible cases within the specified constraints.

- [x] String Transformation

For the string transformation challenge, I created a JavaScript function that transforms a given string based on specific rules. The rules include reversing the string if its length is divisible by 3, replacing each character with its ASCII code if the length is divisible by 5, and applying both operations if the length is divisible by both 3 and 5. I handled various edge cases and ensured that the function returned the transformed string as per the provided guidelines.
